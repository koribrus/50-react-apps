## 50 React Apps

This is a self directed tutorial project that recreates each project from the Udemy Course 50 Projects in 50 Days (HTML, CSS & JavaScript) in React by Brad Traversy and Florin Pop. All project concepts are taken from the course authors. All React coding is my own.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
